<h1>Machine Learning Practice Repository</h1>

Welcome to the Machine Learning Practice Repository, a collection of exercises and examples including <b>NumPy,Pandas, and Supervised Learning </b> that I practiced during <b>JanuaryÂ 2025</b>, Currently ongoing work in Unsupervised Learning. This repository is designed to track data manipulation skills, model training techniques, and iterative exploration of machine learning algorithms.
